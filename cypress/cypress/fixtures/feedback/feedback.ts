I mean I grew up in Michigan until I was 12 with all of my, you know, immediate family and then I moved to California where I only had my close family after that, like my mom and my brother and sister, but before moving, Yeah, we would have thanksgiving dinner together all the time. Pretty much every holiday you can think of. We would get together for all holidays and outside of holiday season. Maybe we would always get together once a month to eat and just hang out. It was a lot of fun from hanging out with cousins.",
