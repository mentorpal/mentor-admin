              "transcript": "Well, the first thing you want to do is you want to find out what g p a like What's the minimum G p A. That you need for the programs to what you want to apply. So most programs have a minimum. G p a on, but it may be something like 3.6. And so what that essentially means is that if you're G p A isn't 3.6, don't bother applying. Now they say that, but that's not necessarily true. So if your G p. A. Is less than whatever it is the school's you're applying to want, you have a couple of options. Um, if your GP is pretty close. So let's say the minimum G p A is 3.6, you have a 3.5. You might want to just take a few more classes and get a few mores and raise your G p A. That way. Um, I would only recommend that strategy if your overall G p. A. Is really, really close to whatever the cut office. Um, if it's farther from the cut off, then one of the things that you can do is you can take a look at your own transcripts and see, you know, why is your g p l o? Oftentimes the story is that, you know, sometimes usually it's early on in college, you know, maybe the second or third, or even first semester When you know people are still adjusting to being college students. They have a semester to where they don't do great in some classes, and so they may have some CS or DS. Or, you know, even if, um and those air really dragging down their overall G p A. Even if they recovered. And if you look at you know, the past couple of years, they've got nothing but straight A's. Those early bad grades are going to kind of drive down their overall G p A. Because it's a mean, um, so one of the things if that's the case that your in your overall GP is low. But maybe like your last, your most recent work is really, really good. Um, you can address that and most of the time on your transcript, for instance, it will calculate your overall G p A. But it will also just calculate your GP within your major so if your GP within your major is really high, then in that case, I would address that in your personal statement and say something like, You know, even though my overall GP is low, if you look at my transcripts, you can see that it was due to this, you know, one semester. And this is what was going on. You know, maybe there's a reason it was low that semester. Um, you know, But in the last two years, you can see that I've got a 4.0, average you know, in my major. And so that's kind of a sign that you've grown in the last couple of years. You've matured into a really good student. Another thing that you can dio is you can see if you can make a personal connection at this program. So this is where you're going to talk to your mentors. Um, talk to other people in your network and see if anybody knows anybody you know, at the program toe what you want to apply that you could maybe have a conversation with and say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested in your program. Here's my problem, you know, and Maybe they might have some advice for you. Or maybe they'll just say, you know, we'll keep an eye out from your application or something like that. Um, you may also wanna have your letter writers directly address this in their letters, so make them aware of this issue. I'm applying to a school, my overall GPS and high enough. But, you know, here's my GP for the last two years. It's much better. Could you specifically talk about this in my letter and say, You know what a good student I am and that kind of stuff and most letter writers, I mean, we want to write letters that are going to help you succeed. And so that information is totally fine to give to give to your letter writers. So, you know, those were some of your options. If your G p A is a little bit lower, then you know what you want it to be for. For applying Thio graduate schools",

And at the same time, the Marine Corps utilizes Navy chaplains to serve for them. So within the Marine Corps, you also have the air wing, you have logistics, you have division with the ground, and you have re kon and Special Forces with the Marines. And finally, we also served with the Coast Guard.

              "transcript": "I actually love the idea of a gap year. I'll be honest. Um, that really wasn't a thing. I think when I was going through graduate school, it was just kind of one thing after another. Also, I personally knew my own temperament, and I had a sneaking suspicion that if I stopped my educational journey that I would not restart it. Um and so I just did not allow myself to take any kind of break between any of my programs. So I went right from my bachelors degree, to my master's degree to my PhD, Um, but I do think that taking a gap year could be really beneficial, particularly if you use that time wisely. Um, so if you use that gap year to explore the field, like if you think you want Thio, you know, do clinical psychology with Children, and you use that gap year to like work with Children in some capacity to see if this is maybe a population that you are okay working with. That's a great use of a gap year. Um, I think you can use the Gap year to take some more classes or do some more independent study learn more about the field off psychology in the different areas within it, so that when you do apply to graduate school, you're making a much more informed choice that that you're and that's gonna help you really select graduate schools or programs that are going thio be beneficial to you. Um, so I like the idea of a gap here. I don't think that it discredits the student at all, particularly if they could say, like, this is what I like. You know, if you can kind of spin it as an intentional gap here, I think that actually looks very mature. So I think a gap here is a good idea if it's done correctly.",

And I remember dropping all of my applications. I just had this big batch. I think I applied to, like, 10 schools. And so I had this huge batch of application packets going out to all these schools, and I put them into the mailbox at, like, the post office where you kind of have the little drawer that you pull and push him in there and then slammed the door off they go.

Um, I think that as a researcher and having been a researcher for almost 30 years now, I have learned that this is just par for the course. There's always gonna be setbacks. You're always gonna have to go back to the beginning or at least close to the beginning or re think and re approach. Um, And so I guess what I've learned from the work that I've done up to this point is that setbacks are temporary. Um, you just have toe, you know, keep going. And eventually you will either get to where you wanna be or the place where you wanna be.

              "transcript": "Well, the first thing you want to do is you want to find out what g p a like What's the minimum G p A. That you need for the programs to what you want to apply. So most programs have a minimum. G p a on, but it may be something like 3.6. And so what that essentially means is that if you're G p A isn't 3.6, don't bother applying. Now they say that, but that's not necessarily true. So if your G p. A. Is less than whatever it is the school's you're applying to want, you have a couple of options. Um, if your GP is pretty close. So let's say the minimum G p A is 3.6, you have a 3.5. You might want to just take a few more classes and get a few mores and raise your G p A. That way. Um, I would only recommend that strategy if your overall G p. A. Is really, really close to whatever the cut office. Um, if it's farther from the cut off, then one of the things that you can do is you can take a look at your own transcripts and see, you know, why is your g p l o? Oftentimes the story is that, you know, sometimes usually it's early on in college, you know, maybe the second or third, or even first semester When you know people are still adjusting to being college students. They have a semester to where they don't do great in some classes, and so they may have some CS or DS. Or, you know, even if, um and those air really dragging down their overall G p A. Even if they recovered. And if you look at you know, the past couple of years, they've got nothing but straight A's. Those early bad grades are going to kind of drive down their overall G p A. Because it's a mean, um, so one of the things if that's the case that your in your overall GP is low. But maybe like your last, your most recent work is really, really good. Um, you can address that and most of the time on your transcript, for instance, it will calculate your overall G p A. But it will also just calculate your GP within your major so if your GP within your major is really high, then in that case, I would address that in your personal statement and say something like, You know, even though my overall GP is low, if you look at my transcripts, you can see that it was due to this, you know, one semester. And this is what was going on. You know, maybe there's a reason it was low that semester. Um, you know, But in the last two years, you can see that I've got a 4.0, average you know, in my major. And so that's kind of a sign that you've grown in the last couple of years. You've matured into a really good student. Another thing that you can dio is you can see if you can make a personal connection at this program. So this is where you're going to talk to your mentors. Um, talk to other people in your network and see if anybody knows anybody you know, at the program toe what you want to apply that you could maybe have a conversation with and say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested in your program. Here's my problem, you know, and Maybe they might have some advice for you. Or maybe they'll just say, you know, we'll keep an eye out from your application or something like that. Um, you may also wanna have your letter writers directly address this in their letters, so make them aware of this issue. I'm applying to a school, my overall GPS and high enough. But, you know, here's my GP for the last two years. It's much better. Could you specifically talk about this in my letter and say, You know what a good student I am and that kind of stuff and most letter writers, I mean, we want to write letters that are going to help you succeed. And so that information is totally fine to give to give to your letter writers. So, you know, those were some of your options. If your G p A is a little bit lower, then you know what you want it to be for. For applying Thio graduate schools",

The legal resource is the wills, the general power of attorneys making sure that they have, um, something to communicate with their family.

              "transcript": "Well, the first thing you want to do is you want to find out what g p a like What's the minimum G p A. That you need for the programs to what you want to apply. So most programs have a minimum. G p a on, but it may be something like 3.6. And so what that essentially means is that if you're G p A isn't 3.6, don't bother applying. Now they say that, but that's not necessarily true. So if your G p. A. Is less than whatever it is the school's you're applying to want, you have a couple of options. Um, if your GP is pretty close. So let's say the minimum G p A is 3.6, you have a 3.5. You might want to just take a few more classes and get a few mores and raise your G p A. That way. Um, I would only recommend that strategy if your overall G p. A. Is really, really close to whatever the cut office. Um, if it's farther from the cut off, then one of the things that you can do is you can take a look at your own transcripts and see, you know, why is your g p l o? Oftentimes the story is that, you know, sometimes usually it's early on in college, you know, maybe the second or third, or even first semester When you know people are still adjusting to being college students. They have a semester to where they don't do great in some classes, and so they may have some CS or DS. Or, you know, even if, um and those air really dragging down their overall G p A. Even if they recovered. And if you look at you know, the past couple of years, they've got nothing but straight A's. Those early bad grades are going to kind of drive down their overall G p A. Because it's a mean, um, so one of the things if that's the case that your in your overall GP is low. But maybe like your last, your most recent work is really, really good. Um, you can address that and most of the time on your transcript, for instance, it will calculate your overall G p A. But it will also just calculate your GP within your major so if your GP within your major is really high, then in that case, I would address that in your personal statement and say something like, You know, even though my overall GP is low, if you look at my transcripts, you can see that it was due to this, you know, one semester. And this is what was going on. You know, maybe there's a reason it was low that semester. Um, you know, But in the last two years, you can see that I've got a 4.0, average you know, in my major. And so that's kind of a sign that you've grown in the last couple of years. You've matured into a really good student. Another thing that you can dio is you can see if you can make a personal connection at this program. So this is where you're going to talk to your mentors. Um, talk to other people in your network and see if anybody knows anybody you know, at the program toe what you want to apply that you could maybe have a conversation with and say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested in your program. Here's my problem, you know, and Maybe they might have some advice for you. Or maybe they'll just say, you know, we'll keep an eye out from your application or something like that. Um, you may also wanna have your letter writers directly address this in their letters, so make them aware of this issue. I'm applying to a school, my overall GPS and high enough. But, you know, here's my GP for the last two years. It's much better. Could you specifically talk about this in my letter and say, You know what a good student I am and that kind of stuff and most letter writers, I mean, we want to write letters that are going to help you succeed. And so that information is totally fine to give to give to your letter writers. So, you know, those were some of your options. If your G p A is a little bit lower, then you know what you want it to be for. For applying Thio graduate schools",

Um, and I think that that's probably true, You know, for me, I You know, I definitely feel like I work very hard, Um, relative to the compensation that I receive. Andi, I think that if I was just in it for the money, I probably would have quit long ago because the compensation is just not there. Um, in terms of being able toe live on my salary, I think that depends on a lot of things. I mean, number one, I live in Southern California, which is one of the most expensive places to live. And so, you know, given my salary Yeah, I mean, it would it would be really tight. My husband, I'm married and my husband also works. And so we're a dual income family, and that allows us thio afford the life that we have. Um, if he lost his job and we lost his income, um, I think we could make it, but I think that our lives would be very much different than they are right now. Um, on the other hand, I have a friend who is also a professor and works at a State University. But she's in North Carolina and she makes the same amount that I dio. But she essentially has more money than I dio because her dollars go much farther because she's in North Carolina. Eso if you look a, you know, housing prices. If you look even that things just like groceries. Like, what's the cost of milk and what's the cost of gas? Um, it's much lower in other parts of the country. And so in Southern California in particular, you know, we're just we have a very high cost of living. And so every dollar doesn't go a Sfar. Um now that also, you know, what do you mean by making it? Well, I mean, that also depends on the lifestyle that you wanna lead. Um, my husband and I and our Children, we really enjoy traveling, And so we try thio travel a much as we possibly can, and we've gone to a lot of really great places of the family. We've gone to Scotland and we've gone to Bali and we've gone to Brazil, um, to name a few places. But we afford that by cutting back in other places. So, you know, we live actually pretty simply, um and and we use the money that we save from living simply thio put towards, you know, other things like travel adventures, eso it's, you know, it's kind of hard Thio say you know how much a given salary is gonna afford because it really just depends on the kind of life that you wanna live. If I wanted toe, you know, drive a really awesome fancy car and eat out all the time and wear designer clothes and travel and, you know, by a lot of stuff, then no, my salary would not allow for that. But for the life that I do live, um, you know, I would say that my salary is pretty good. I mean, I don't know about supporting, like, the whole family on this salary. Um, although again, you know, my husband and I have talked about it, and if his income was to just evaporate, which is possible because he works in the private sector, um, you know, it would be different and there would be things that we would definitely have to cut, but I think we could get by on my salary",

              "transcript": "Well, the first thing you want to do is you want to find out what g p a like What's the minimum G p A. That you need for the programs to what you want to apply. So most programs have a minimum. G p a on, but it may be something like 3.6. And so what that essentially means is that if you're G p A isn't 3.6, don't bother applying. Now they say that, but that's not necessarily true. So if your G p. A. Is less than whatever it is the school's you're applying to want, you have a couple of options. Um, if your GP is pretty close. So let's say the minimum G p A is 3.6, you have a 3.5. You might want to just take a few more classes and get a few mores and raise your G p A. That way. Um, I would only recommend that strategy if your overall G p. A. Is really, really close to whatever the cut office. Um, if it's farther from the cut off, then one of the things that you can do is you can take a look at your own transcripts and see, you know, why is your g p l o? Oftentimes the story is that, you know, sometimes usually it's early on in college, you know, maybe the second or third, or even first semester When you know people are still adjusting to being college students. They have a semester to where they don't do great in some classes, and so they may have some CS or DS. Or, you know, even if, um and those air really dragging down their overall G p A. Even if they recovered. And if you look at you know, the past couple of years, they've got nothing but straight A's. Those early bad grades are going to kind of drive down their overall G p A. Because it's a mean, um, so one of the things if that's the case that your in your overall GP is low. But maybe like your last, your most recent work is really, really good. Um, you can address that and most of the time on your transcript, for instance, it will calculate your overall G p A. But it will also just calculate your GP within your major so if your GP within your major is really high, then in that case, I would address that in your personal statement and say something like, You know, even though my overall GP is low, if you look at my transcripts, you can see that it was due to this, you know, one semester. And this is what was going on. You know, maybe there's a reason it was low that semester. Um, you know, But in the last two years, you can see that I've got a 4.0, average you know, in my major. And so that's kind of a sign that you've grown in the last couple of years. You've matured into a really good student. Another thing that you can dio is you can see if you can make a personal connection at this program. So this is where you're going to talk to your mentors. Um, talk to other people in your network and see if anybody knows anybody you know, at the program toe what you want to apply that you could maybe have a conversation with and say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested in your program. Here's my problem, you know, and Maybe they might have some advice for you. Or maybe they'll just say, you know, we'll keep an eye out from your application or something like that. Um, you may also wanna have your letter writers directly address this in their letters, so make them aware of this issue. I'm applying to a school, my overall GPS and high enough. But, you know, here's my GP for the last two years. It's much better. Could you specifically talk about this in my letter and say, You know what a good student I am and that kind of stuff and most letter writers, I mean, we want to write letters that are going to help you succeed. And so that information is totally fine to give to give to your letter writers. So, you know, those were some of your options. If your G p A is a little bit lower, then you know what you want it to be for. For applying Thio graduate schools",

It was just kind of like, This is the place I grew up. Eso it had good things and bad things. You know, we spent a lot of time at the beach. We spent a lot of time outdoors. Um, but it was also, for me, a little confining. So, for instance, when I finished high school, my Onley objective at that point was to leave Hawaii and go someplace else.

Um, my career path or trajectory from kind of like when I started, let's say in college and now is not a linear process. It all, um or at least not a straight line. Um, if I had to maybe isolate some key decisions, that kind of got me to where I am now, I think that the first one probably would have been taking that taking the bio psychology class when I was still working on my bachelors degree. Um, I had entered psychology initially, just kind of with the assumption that I was going to be a clinician. Um, but honestly, my heart really wasn't in it. I much preferred, you know, like, kind of like biology and those types of things on dso. When I took the bio psychology class, it was this this wonderful marriage of biology and psychology, and that was the class that really just set me on fire. And I was like, I need to know more about this. Um, now, unfortunately, I took that class literally the spring that I was supposed to graduate. So I was, like, done with my bachelor's degree at that point. And so here I waas like, this is what I want to dio but I don't know anything about it. And so I ended up enrolling in graduate school and first I was in a master's program, um, and learn more about it, and that made me just love it even more. And so at that point, I decided I wanted to keep going with my education. And that was probably the second big decision that I made was I'm going to pursue ah ph. D in bio psychology Neuroscience. Um, so I did that and, you know, learned even more about this amazing field and consistently was inspired and just loving what I dio eso I finished my PhD degree. I took a job in a postdoctoral position. Um and then I would say the next day Biggest piece of the puzzle. Waas. Some one of my mentors encouraged me. Thio apply Thio Cal State Fullerton. They were looking for someone to teach bio psychology and she encouraged me to apply, and honestly, at the time, I wasn't really interested. I was I was in the middle of a big project that I was very engaged in Andi. I wasn't looking. Thio become a teacher anyways. Um, but she said she just advised me like, Just do it. Just do it for the practice. If nothing else, just get you. You're gonna be on the job market soon, so just get used to interviewing. And this is great practice for you. And so I did. I put my application together and I applied, and I actually did get a call back and an on campus interview, and I went and I ended up getting the job, and that was that, and that's that's how I got here.",

So, for instance, of students are working a lot of hours, you know, taking 12 to 15 units may not really be reasonable for them, especially if they have any other commitments, like family commitments or, you know, friends or things like that. So I think taking on too much not being realistic about your actual available time and energy and putting things off until, for instance, there do so I, for instance, have papers in my class, and I can't even tell you how many times students will turn in papers late because they waited until the last minute to start it. And then, you know, the Internet went down or some other calamity happened. But the thing is that the paper assignments are available on the first day of class, and so not, you know, not doing things in a timely manner and kind of procrastinating, and then trying to catch up with the end, I think, is not a good habit to get into",

Um, and I think that that's probably true, You know, for me, I You know, I definitely feel like I work very hard, Um, relative to the compensation that I receive. Andi, I think that if I was just in it for the money, I probably would have quit long ago because the compensation is just not there. Um, in terms of being able toe live on my salary, I think that depends on a lot of things. I mean, number one, I live in Southern California, which is one of the most expensive places to live. And so, you know, given my salary Yeah, I mean, it would it would be really tight. My husband, I'm married and my husband also works. And so we're a dual income family, and that allows us thio afford the life that we have. Um, if he lost his job and we lost his income, um, I think we could make it, but I think that our lives would be very much different than they are right now. Um, on the other hand, I have a friend who is also a professor and works at a State University. But she's in North Carolina and she makes the same amount that I dio. But she essentially has more money than I dio because her dollars go much farther because she's in North Carolina. Eso if you look a, you know, housing prices. If you look even that things just like groceries. Like, what's the cost of milk and what's the cost of gas? Um, it's much lower in other parts of the country. And so in Southern California in particular, you know, we're just we have a very high cost of living. And so every dollar doesn't go a Sfar. Um now that also, you know, what do you mean by making it? Well, I mean, that also depends on the lifestyle that you wanna lead. Um, my husband and I and our Children, we really enjoy traveling, And so we try thio travel a much as we possibly can, and we've gone to a lot of really great places of the family. We've gone to Scotland and we've gone to Bali and we've gone to Brazil, um, to name a few places. But we afford that by cutting back in other places. So, you know, we live actually pretty simply, um and and we use the money that we save from living simply thio put towards, you know, other things like travel adventures, eso it's, you know, it's kind of hard Thio say you know how much a given salary is gonna afford because it really just depends on the kind of life that you wanna live. If I wanted toe, you know, drive a really awesome fancy car and eat out all the time and wear designer clothes and travel and, you know, by a lot of stuff, then no, my salary would not allow for that. But for the life that I do live, um, you know, I would say that my salary is pretty good. I mean, I don't know about supporting, like, the whole family on this salary. Um, although again, you know, my husband and I have talked about it, and if his income was to just evaporate, which is possible because he works in the private sector, um, you know, it would be different and there would be things that we would definitely have to cut, but I think we could get by on my salary",
